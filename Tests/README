Description:
1) Hybrid_no_res_hist: It's practically the hybrid from before, but with no convergence tracking and residual history tracking
2) TEST_CWNO/TEST_molecules: residual tracking but a bad version of it. Not ideal. Same code for the two, but in one you work with the CWNO and in the other with molecules
